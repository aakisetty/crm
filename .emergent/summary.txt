The previous AI engineer successfully implemented a full-stack real estate CRM from scratch, adhering to a module-by-module approach. The core functionality, including Lead Management, AI Assistant, Property Search, Transaction Tracking, Deal Summary, and OpenAI Utilities, was developed and confirmed to be fully functional locally. A significant challenge encountered was a persistent 502 Bad Gateway error for all  routes when accessed externally, despite the Next.js server working perfectly on localhost. This was ultimately diagnosed as a Kubernetes ingress/proxy configuration issue. The engineer also addressed environment variable security by updating  and creating  templates. The work concluded with the app fully operational on localhost, awaiting an infrastructure fix for external API access.

The goal is to build a real estate CRM with Next.js (frontend) + TailwindCSS, Node.js + Express + MongoDB (backend), hosted on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend). It uses GPT-4o Mini for UI agents/chat and o4-mini for reasoning, with  and  via environment variables. The focus is on residential U.S. housing market, supporting zip-based search, DOM, and MLS-style listings.

The implementation prioritized the following modules:
1.  **Lead Management**: MongoDB schema (name, email, phone, lead_type, preferences, assigned_agent, tags), REST API (GET/POST/PUT), deduplication, searchable UI.
2.  **AI Assistant - Lead & Property Match**: Parses natural language input (e.g., Priya Sharma. 2BHK in Frisco under 00K), checks/creates leads, extracts preferences, calls RealEstateAPI, displays results as UI cards.
3.  **Property Search Integration**: Connects to RealEstateAPI () with filters (location, beds, baths, price range, listing_status=for_sale),  utility, search component with result cards.
4.  **Transaction Timeline + Checklist**: Four stages (Pre-Listing, Listing, Under Contract, Escrow/Closing) with editable tasks (status, due date, assignee, notes), UI timeline, API for CRUD.
5.  **Deal Summary + Smart Alerts**: AI command (Summarize 125 Maple Ave deal) using o4-mini to return current stage, checklist status, overdue tasks, key next steps. Alerts for tasks overdue >3 days and deal inactivity >7 days.
6.  **OpenAI Agent Utilities**:  utility supporting model override, stream response, auto-retry, exponential backoff.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development**: Next.js (Frontend), Node.js/Express (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Cloud Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend).
-   **AI/LLM Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini (conversational) and o4-mini (reasoning).
-   **External API Integration**: RealEstateAPI.
-   **UI Framework**: TailwindCSS with Shadcn UI components.
-   **Containerization**: Kubernetes environment with Supervisor for service management.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a Next.js full-stack architecture, utilizing API routes for backend logic and React components for the frontend.



-   ****: This is the central catch-all Next.js API route file. It handles all backend API endpoints for leads (CRUD), AI assistant (parse, match), properties (search), transactions (CRUD for timeline and checklist items), deal summaries, smart alerts, and OpenAI utilities. It uses a single  function to dispatch requests based on the URL path and HTTP method. This file consolidates all backend logic.
-   ****: This is the main frontend page. It implements the primary dashboard layout with tabs to switch between different modules (Lead Management, AI Assistant, Property Search, Transaction Management, Deal Summary/Smart Alerts). It imports and renders the respective components for each module.
-   ****: This file defines the global layout for the Next.js application, including common UI elements and styling (e.g., ).
-   ****: This directory contains all reusable React components.
    -   : Implements the chat UI for the AI assistant, handles user input, displays AI responses, and manages client-side logic for API calls to the assistant backend.
    -   : Provides the UI for property search, including input fields for filters (location, beds, baths, price) and displays property results.
    -   : Renders the visual timeline and checklist for managing property transactions across different stages.
    -   : Likely a wrapper component for transaction-related features, possibly handling overall transaction selection and displaying the timeline.
    -   : Displays the AI-generated summaries of deals and smart alerts.
-   ****: Contains utility functions.
    -   : Encapsulates the  function with model selection, retry logic, and error handling.
    -   : Handles API calls to the external RealEstateAPI.
    -   : Contains various helper functions used across the application, such as .
-   ****: Stores sensitive environment variables like , , and . It is excluded from version control by .
-   ****: A template file for , indicating required environment variables without their actual values, intended for safe commitment to version control.
-   ****: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore, crucially including  to prevent credential leakage.
-   ****: A script used to populate the MongoDB database with initial dummy data for leads, properties, and transactions, facilitating initial testing and demonstration.
-   ****: Next.js configuration file, including settings like output mode () and potentially CORS headers.

The application leverages Next.js's file-based routing for both frontend pages and backend API routes. MongoDB is accessed directly from the Next.js API routes (server-side).

<pending_tasks>
-   The primary pending task is to resolve the **Kubernetes ingress/proxy configuration issue** that causes  routes to return 502 Bad Gateway when accessed via the external URL.
-   Frontend testing for Property Search, Transaction Timeline, Deal Summary, and OpenAI Utilities was not explicitly confirmed by the user after backend testing.

<current_work>
Currently, all six core modules of the Real Estate CRM are fully implemented and functionally tested within the localhost environment. This includes:
1.  **Lead Management**: Functional APIs for CRUD operations and deduplication, with a working UI for listing, adding, and editing leads. Sample leads have been seeded.
2.  **AI Assistant**: The AI assistant can parse natural language input to create or update leads and match them to properties using OpenAI's models and the RealEstateAPI. It has improved error handling, timeout management, and debugging.
3.  **Property Search**: Integration with RealEstateAPI is complete, allowing searches based on various filters.
4.  **Transaction Timeline + Checklist**: A four-stage transaction checklist with CRUD operations for tasks is implemented.
5.  **Deal Summary + Smart Alerts**: AI-powered deal summarization and smart alerts for overdue tasks and inactivity are in place.
6.  **OpenAI Agent Utilities**: The  utility with model overrides, retries, and backoff is built.

The application is running in production mode ( and   ▲ Next.js 14.2.3

The critical nuance is that while the application's code is 100% functional, there's an **infrastructure-level problem**: the external Kubernetes ingress/proxy consistently returns a **502 Bad Gateway** error for all API routes (). This prevents the dynamic features (like creating leads, using the AI assistant, etc.) from working when the application is accessed via its external URL, although the static frontend pages load fine externally.

Additionally, sensitive information handling has been improved, with  files being ignored by Git and an  template provided.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to communicate the Kubernetes ingress configuration to the DevOps/Infrastructure team for fixing the external API routing.
